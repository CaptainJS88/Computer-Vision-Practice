# Computer Vision Project

A collection of computer vision projects I'm working on to learn image processing, object detection, and related techniques.

## Projects

### 🛣️ [Lane Detection](./LanePerception/)
A basic lane detection system that processes road images and dashcam videos to identify and highlight lane markings using edge detection and Hough Transform.

## Getting Started

Each project has its own README with specific requirements and instructions. Check out the individual project folders for details!

## Technologies

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
